## What's Working Now

âœ… **S3 Upload Features:**

- Direct browser-to-S3 uploads using presigned URLs
- Automatic file validation (type and size)
- Image preview before saving
- Secure storage in your S3 bucket
- Automatic cleanup when deleting realtors

âœ… **Security Features:**

- Presigned URLs expire after 5 minutes
- Files are organized in `realtors/headshots/` folder
- Each file gets a unique UUID to prevent conflicts
- Only authenticated users can upload

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. **Check S3 Permissions**: Ensure your IAM user has these permissions:

   - `s3:PutObject`
   - `s3:GetObject`
   - `s3:DeleteObject`
   - `s3:ListBucket`

2. **Verify Environment Variables**: Check that all are set in `.env.local`:

   ```
   AWS_REGION=your-region
   AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-access-key
   AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret-key
   AWS_S3_BUCKET_NAME=photos4remedia
   ```

3. **Restart Development Server**: After changing environment variables:

   ```bash
   # Stop the server (Ctrl+C)
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Check Browser Console**: Look for any error messages when uploading

## S3 Bucket Structure

Your uploads are organized as follows:

```
photos4remedia/
â””â”€â”€ realtors/
    â””â”€â”€ headshots/
        â”œâ”€â”€ uuid1.jpg
        â”œâ”€â”€ uuid2.png
        â””â”€â”€ uuid3.webp
```

## Next Steps

Now that S3 uploads are working, you can:

1. Add more file types (documents, videos)
2. Implement image resizing/optimization
3. Add progress bars for uploads
4. Create galleries for multiple images per realtor
5. Add drag-and-drop upload functionality

## Success! ðŸŽ‰

Your real estate photography platform now has full S3 integration for managing realtor headshots. The system is production-ready and can handle file uploads securely and efficiently!
