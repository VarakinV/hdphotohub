## 🔧 How to Test the Client Management System

### Prerequisites:

1. **AWS S3 Setup** (Required for headshot uploads):
   - Create an S3 bucket
   - Configure CORS for direct browser uploads
   - Update `.env.local` with your AWS credentials:
   ```env
   AWS_REGION="us-east-1"
   AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="your-access-key"
   AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="your-secret-key"
   AWS_S3_BUCKET_NAME="your-bucket-name"
   ```

### Testing Flow:

#### A. Access the Clients Page:

1. Login to the admin dashboard
2. Click on the "Realtors" card or navigate to `/admin/clients`
3. You'll see the client management interface

#### B. Add a New Realtor:

1. Click "Add Realtor" button
2. Fill in the form:
   - First Name (required)
   - Last Name (required)
   - Email (required, must be unique)
   - Phone (optional)
   - Upload headshot (optional, JPEG/PNG/WebP, max 5MB)
3. Click "Create Realtor"
4. The realtor will appear in the table

#### C. Edit a Realtor:

1. Click the pencil icon in the Actions column
2. Update any information
3. Change or remove the headshot
4. Click "Update Realtor"

#### D. Delete a Realtor:

1. Click the trash icon in the Actions column
2. Confirm deletion in the dialog
3. The realtor and their headshot will be permanently deleted

## 📊 Database Schema

The Realtor table structure:

```prisma
model Realtor {
  id         String   @id @default(cuid())
  firstName  String
  lastName   String
  email      String   @unique
  phone      String?
  headshot   String?  // S3 URL
  userId     String   // Admin who created this realtor
  user       User     @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
  createdAt  DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt  DateTime @updatedAt
}
```

## 🔐 Security Features

1. **Authentication Required**: All realtor operations require admin authentication
2. **User Isolation**: Admins can only see/edit their own realtors
3. **Secure Uploads**: Presigned URLs for direct S3 uploads (no server processing)
4. **Input Validation**: Email format, file type, and size validation
5. **Unique Constraints**: Email addresses must be unique across all realtors

## 🎨 UI Components Used

- **Shadcn UI Components**:
  - Table (for realtor list)
  - Dialog (for add/edit form)
  - AlertDialog (for delete confirmation)
  - Avatar (for headshot display)
  - Form components with validation
  - Toast notifications

## 📸 S3 Configuration

### Required S3 Bucket CORS Configuration:

```json
[
  {
    "AllowedHeaders": ["*"],
    "AllowedMethods": ["GET", "PUT", "POST", "DELETE"],
    "AllowedOrigins": ["http://localhost:3000"],
    "ExposeHeaders": ["ETag"]
  }
]
```

### S3 Bucket Policy (Public Read for Headshots):

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name/realtors/headshots/*"
    }
  ]
}
```

## 🚀 Performance Optimizations

- **Direct S3 Uploads**: Files go directly from browser to S3 (no server processing)
- **Presigned URLs**: Secure, temporary upload URLs (5-minute expiry)
- **Image Preview**: Local preview before upload completes
- **Optimistic UI**: Immediate feedback with loading states

## 🎯 Next Steps (Future Milestones)

### Milestone 3: Order Management

- Create Order model with property data
- Multi-tab interface for orders
- Property information management
- Link orders to realtors

### Milestone 4: Media Handling

- Photo upload and processing
- Video upload support
- Floor plans and documents
- Bulk operations

### Milestone 5: Client Delivery Pages

- Public pages with unique slugs
- Gallery views
- Download functionality

## ✨ Key Features Delivered

- 📝 Complete CRUD operations for realtors
- 📸 Headshot upload with S3 integration
- 🔍 Search and filter capabilities (ready to implement)
- 📱 Responsive design
- 🔐 Secure, user-isolated data
- 🎨 Professional UI with Shadcn components
- ⚡ Fast, direct-to-S3 uploads
- 🗑️ Automatic S3 cleanup on deletion

## 📝 Notes

- **S3 Configuration**: You need to set up an AWS S3 bucket with proper CORS and permissions
- **Environment Variables**: Update both `.env` and `.env.local` with AWS credentials
- **Testing**: The system works without S3 configured, but headshot uploads will fail
- **Production**: Consider using CloudFront CDN for serving images in production

**Milestone 2 Status: ✅ COMPLETE**

The client management system is fully operational. Admins can now create, read, update, and delete realtor profiles with headshot management via AWS S3. The foundation is set for linking these realtors to property orders in Milestone 3.
